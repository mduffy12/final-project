	Marine plants grow near the surface of salt water and ice, within reach of sunlight necessary for <b>photosynthesis</b>. Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities.  
	<br>
	<br>
	Algae, the most plentiful type of marine plant, form the foundation of the food chain and crucial to a balanced ecosystem. These marine plants have provided fundamental nourishment in the food chain. No marine animals would have evolved or been able to survive if marine plants had not existed.
	<br>
	<br>
	Nutrients are also gathered from particles that currents wash up from sea floors. Marine plants can adapt to specific conditions, such as limited light and underwater caves.
