	<p><img src="images/dolphins.jpg" alt="picture of dolphins">Marine mammals are aquatic mammals that rely on the ocean and other marine ecosystems for their existence. They include animals such as seals, whales, manatees, sea otters and polar bears. They are an informal group, unified only by their reliance on marine environments for feeding and survival. There are approximately 129 different types of marine mammals.

	My favorite marine mammal is the Orca. They are often confused for being a whale because of their name 'killer whale', but did you know that orcas are actually dolphins?  Wild killer whales are not considered a threat to humans and no fatal attack on humans has ever been documented, but there have been cases of captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers at marine theme parks. Killer whales often travel in groups called pods.
