	<p><img src="images/dolphins.jpg" alt="picture of dolphins"> Orcas are often called killer whales. Though they don't typically attack humans, this name is still well-chosen due to the animal's ability to take down large marine animals, such as sea lions and whales. For the most part killer whales are actually considered to be very friendly animals, at least as far as we know and have experienced them to be. They are even the main attraction at several marine parks bringing in thousands of spectators yearly to watch them perform. Killer whales are apex predators. They are considered to be the most powerful killers in the ocean, capable of taking down massive prey like whales - hence their name - and even great white sharks. ... Given what we know about orca, it would be dangerous not to consider them dangerous</p>
